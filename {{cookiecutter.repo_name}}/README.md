# {{cookiecutter.project_name}}
Minimalistic template to create OR projects

## Requirements
- Python 3.13+
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (instead of `pip` or `poetry`)

If you don't have `uv` installed, you can follow the intructions in the uv [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). Make sure `uv` is on your `PATH`.


## Set up

This project uses a `Makefile` to simplify running the most used commands on **Linux** and **macOS**.

1. Install the `orproject` as an editable package with

```
make install
```

## Usage

To run the code:

```
make run
```
